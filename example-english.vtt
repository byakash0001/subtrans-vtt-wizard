00:00:05.885 --> 00:00:06.965
You could say that

2
00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:10.885
I grew up in a working-class family

3
00:00:11.405 --> 00:00:15.165
My father was a pipe fitter in the Navy Yard

4
00:00:15.685 --> 00:00:18.885
My mother was what they used to call a house wife

5
00:00:19.405 --> 00:00:23.525
Today I think people might say she was a full-time mom

6
00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:27.245
but she worked incredibly hard

7
00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:31.525
And I was brought up to understand the dignity of work

8
00:00:32.045 --> 00:00:35.765
and that there are no jobs that are inherently

9
00:00:36.285 --> 00:00:39.485
more valuable than other jobs

10
00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:43.205
It just depends on whether you're contributing something
